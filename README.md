# CDRI-test-assign

This notebook focuses on mainly extracting articles from the the Times of India website and performing preliminary analysies on the text and
also visualizing our results.

Some feaures could not be completed, like some nltk and textblob processes of lemmatization, TF-IDF etc. due to the lack of time

I'll be updating this repository as I have completed all the left out stages.
